Currently, I work as a Visual Merchandiser at <i><a href="https://www.stories.com/sv_se/index.html">& Other Stories</a></i> in Copenhagen.

In my current role, I am responsible of monthly campaigns, the visual and interior set up as well as to create and execute business visual strategy. I have also been involved in preparing in-store macro flows and planograms for new market openings and have supported and signed off on campaign-specific planograms based on local adjustments.
